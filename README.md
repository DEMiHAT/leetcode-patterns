# 🧠 LeetCode Patterns

A structured and methodical repository designed to consolidate **algorithmic design patterns** and **computational problem-solving frameworks**.  
This repository represents a systematic approach to **pattern-based learning**, emphasizing scalability, optimization, and reusability in code logic.

---

## 📘 Overview

The repository is organized around core **algorithmic domains** — Arrays, Graphs, Dynamic Programming, Backtracking, and more.  
Each topic is further divided into difficulty tiers: **Easy**, **Medium**, and **Hard**, reflecting progressive depth in problem-solving and abstraction handling.

The objective is not mere repetition of problems, but the development of a **framework-oriented approach** to algorithmic reasoning — identifying recurring structures and transforming intuition into deterministic patterns.

Each subdirectory contains a dedicated `README.md` documenting:
- **Problem classification**
- **Pattern identification**
- **Algorithmic trade-offs**
- **Time–Space complexity analysis**
- **Language-specific implementation notes**

## ⚙️ Methodology

Each problem is analyzed through a consistent lens of:
- **Pattern Recognition** – detecting recurring computational motifs (e.g., sliding window, DFS/BFS traversal, state compression).  
- **Abstraction Design** – generalizing solutions into reusable functional modules or algorithmic schemas.  
- **Complexity Profiling** – evaluating asymptotic behavior and optimization ceilings.  
- **Language-Agnostic Logic** – focusing on algorithmic integrity before syntactic implementation.

---

## 🧮 Complexity Standards

All solutions follow explicit analytical documentation:
- **Time Complexity:** Defined using Big-O notation with justification.  
- **Space Complexity:** Evaluated for auxiliary data structures and recursion depth.  
- **Optimization Commentary:** Insights into potential algorithmic improvements or alternative approaches.

---

## 💻 Language Implementation Strategy

Primary implementation: **Python 3.x**  
Secondary implementations (progressive integration): **C++**, **C**, and **Rust**

Each language version will maintain consistency in:
- Naming conventions  
- Input/Output schema  
- Documentation metadata  

---

## 🔍 Intended Outcomes

- Develop **algorithmic intuition** through structural decomposition.  
- Build a **library of reusable templates** for real-world technical interviews and production-level optimization tasks.  
- Enhance cognitive transition from **problem-space** to **solution-space modeling**.  
- Establish a **traceable evolution** of algorithmic mastery via version control.

---

## 🧠 Future Extensions

- Automated metadata generation for each problem (`pattern.json`)  
- Complexity visualization graphs using Mermaid syntax  
- Integration with LeetCode API for live stats and sync  
- CLI tool for local search and retrieval of patterns  

---

## 📎 Version Control Protocol

Each commit adheres to the following guidelines:
- `add:` new pattern/problem inclusion  
- `update:` refined approach or optimized complexity  
- `doc:` documentation or analysis update  
- `fix:` correction of logic or boundary condition  

This ensures that the repository history reflects **intellectual progression** rather than simple file addition.
